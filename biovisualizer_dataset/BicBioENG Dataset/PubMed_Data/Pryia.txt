Based on long-term laboratory batch tests in conjunction with 16 s rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomics, this study provides the first detailed assessment of the variable sediment CH4 production in response to different pollution source-associated sewer sediment types and hydrological patterns, while addressing the role of the sediment microbiome. The high CH4-production capability of sanitary sewer sediment is shaped by enriched biologically active substrate and dominated by acetoclastic methanogenesis (genus Methanosaeta). Moreover, it involves syntrophic interactions among fermentation bacteria, hydrogen-producing acetogens and methanogens. Distinct source-associated microbial species, denitrifying bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria occur in storm sewer and illicit discharge-associated (IDA) storm sewer sediments. This reveals their insufficient microbial function capabilities to support efficient methanogenesis. Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (genus Methanobacterium) prevails in both these sediments. In this context, storm sewer sediment has an extremely low CH4-production capability, while IDA storm sewer sediment still shows significant carbon emission through a possibly unique mechanism. Hydrological connections promote the sewer sediment biodegradability and CH4-production capability. In contrast, hydrological disconnection facilitates the prevalence of acetoclastic methanogenesis, sulfate-reducing enzymes, denitrification enzymes and the sulfur-utilizing chemolithoautotrophic denitrifier, which drastically decreases CH4 production. Turbulent suspension of sediments results in relative stagnation of methanogenesis. This work bridges the knowledge gap and will help to stimulate and guide the resolution of 'bottom-up' system-scale carbon budgets and GHG sources, as well as the target CH4 abatement interventions.",16,MESH:D008697,Chemical,methane,175,7,17,-,Chemical,CH4,184,3,18,-,Chemical,CH4,488,3,19,-,Chemical,CH4-,667,4,20,MESH:D006859,Chemical,hydrogen,914,8,21,MESH:D013431,Chemical,sulfate,1032,7,22,-,Chemical,CH4-,1392,4,23,MESH:D002244,Chemical,carbon,1474,6,24,-,Chemical,CH4,1600,3,25,MESH:D013431,Chemical,sulfate,1726,7,26,MESH:D013455,Chemical,sulfur,1784,6,27,-,Chemical,CH4,1864,3,28,MESH:D002244,Chemical,carbon,2080,6,29,-,Chemical,CH4,2134,3,33296733,,1607705352163,chemical@MESH:D013431,chemical@MESH:D008697,chemical@MESH:D013455,chemical@-,chemical@MESH:D006859,chemical@MESH:D002244,Water Res,2020,Chen H,Wang Z,Liu H,Nie Y,Zhu Y,Jia Q,Ding G,Ye J,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dissulfurirhabdus thermomarina SH388T is an anaerobic thermophilic bacterium isolated from a shallow sea hydrothermal vent. D. thermomarina is an obligate chemolithoautotroph able to grow by the disproportionation of sulfite and elemental sulfur. Here, we present the results of the sequencing and analysis of the high-quality draft genome of strain SH388T. The genome consists of a one circular chromosome of 2,461,642 base pairs, has a G + C content of 71.1 mol% and 2267 protein-coding sequences. The genome analysis revealed a complete set of genes essential to CO2 fixation via the reductive acetyl-CoA (Wood-Ljungdahl) pathway and gluconeogenesis. The genome of D. thermomarina encodes a complete set of genes necessary for the dissimilatory reduction of sulfates, which are probably involved in the disproportionation of sulfur.

Predictions of physiological traits in metagenomic studies relying on the presence of dsrAB, other dsr genes or combinations thereof suffer from the lack of information on crucial Dsr proteins. The iron-sulfur flavoprotein DsrL is an example of this group. It has a documented essential function during sulfur oxidation and was recently also found in some metagenomes of probable sulfate and sulfite reducers. Here, we show that DsrL and reverse acting rDsrAB can form a complex and are co-purified from the phototrophic sulfur oxidizer Allochromatium vinosum. Recombinant DsrL exhibits NAD(P)H:acceptor oxidoreductase activity with a strong preference for NADH over NADPH. In vitro, the rDsrABL complex effectively catalyzes NADH-dependent sulfite reduction, which is strongly enhanced by the sulfur-binding protein DsrC. Our work reveals NAD+ as suitable in vivo electron acceptor for sulfur oxidation in organisms operating the rDsr pathway, and points to reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides as electron donors for sulfite reduction in sulfate/sulfite-reducing prokaryotes that contain DsrL.

Magnetosome biogenesis is primarily studied in two closely related Alphaproteobacteria of the genus Magnetospirillum that form cubooctahedral-shaped magnetite crystals within a lipid membrane. However, chemically and structurally distinct magnetic particles have been found in physiologically and phylogenetically diverse bacteria. Due to a lack of molecular genetic tools, the mechanistic diversity of magnetosome formation remains poorly understood. Desulfovibrio magneticus RS-1 is an anaerobic sulfate-reducing deltaproteobacterium that forms bullet-shaped magnetite crystals. A recent forward genetic screen identified 10 genes in the conserved magnetosome gene island of D. magneticus that are essential for its magnetic phenotype. However, this screen likely missed mutants with defects in crystal size, shape, and arrangement. Reverse genetics to target the remaining putative magnetosome genes using standard genetic methods of suicide vector integration have not been feasible due to the low transconjugation efficiency. Here, we present a reverse genetic method for targeted mutagenesis in D. magneticus using a replicative plasmid. To test this method, we generated a mutant resistant to 5-fluorouracil by making a markerless deletion of the upp gene that encodes uracil phosphoribosyltransferase. We also used this method for targeted marker exchange mutagenesis by replacing kupM, a gene identified in our previous screen as a magnetosome formation factor, with a streptomycin resistance cassette. Overall, our results show that targeted mutagenesis using a replicative plasmid is effective in D. magneticus and may also be applied to other genetically recalcitrant bacteria.IMPORTANCE Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are a group of organisms that form intracellular nanometer-scale magnetic crystals though a complex process involving lipid and protein scaffolds. These magnetic crystals and their lipid membranes, termed magnetosomes, are model systems for studying bacterial cell biology and biomineralization and are potential platforms for biotechnological applications. Due to a lack of genetic tools and unculturable representatives, the mechanisms of magnetosome formation in phylogenetically deeply branching MTB remain unknown.

These bacteria are useful in the bioremediation of heavy metal pollution since they can reduce/precipitate metals. Previously, we identified the Alishewanella strain WH16-1 from soil of a copper and iron mine and determined that it can reduce sulfate and chromate and that it was tolerant to many heavy metals. In this study, we investigated the chromate reduction mechanism of strain WH16-1 through Tn5 transposon mutagenesis. A cytochrome bd (cytbd) Tn5 mutant was generated (Deltacytbd), and a detail analysis showed that the following: (1) gene cydE (coding for a GbsR-type regulator) was co-transcribed with the two subunits coding genes of the Cytochrome bd complex (Cytbd), namely, cydA and cydB, based on RT-PCR analysis, and similar gene arrangements were also found in other Alteromonadaceae family strains; (2) the chromate resistance level was dramatically decreased and chromate reduction efficiency also decreased in strain Deltacytbd compared to the wild-type and a complemented strain (Deltacytbd-C); (3) Cytbd could catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 according to the analyses of H2O2 decomposition ability, cellular H2O2 contents, H2O2 inhibition zone, and H2O2 sensitivity tests; (4) surprisingly, chromate was not an inducer of the expression of Cytbd, but sulfate induced expression of Cytbd, and sulfate/sulfide resistance levels were also decreased in the Deltacytbd strain; (5) the addition of sulfate enhanced the chromate resistance level and reduction efficiency; (6) Cytbd expression was repressed by CydE and derepressed by sulfate based on an in vivo bacterial one hybrid system and in vitro EMSA tests; and (7) DNA footprinting and short-fragment EMSA tests revealed two binding sites of CydE in its promoter region. All these results showed that Cytbd is negatively regulated by CydE and derepressed by sulfate. In addition, Cytbd contributes to the resistance of sulfate and sulfide, and sulfide could be used as a reductant to reduce chromate. Moreover, Cytbd is essential to decompose H2O2 to decrease cellular oxidative stress. Thus, the regulation and function of Cytbd may explain why sulfate could enhance chromate reduction.",21,MESH:D013431,Chemical,Sulfate,153,7,22,MESH:D013431,Chemical,sulfate,218,7,23,MESH:D008670,Chemical,metal,308,5,24,1651088,Species,Alishewanella strain,396,20,25,1651088,Species,WH16-1,417,6,26,MESH:D003300,Chemical,copper,439,6,27,MESH:D007501,Chemical,iron,450,4,28,MESH:D013431,Chemical,sulfate,494,7,29,1651088,Species,WH16-1,636,6,30,MESH:C566125,Disease,chromate reduction efficiency,1134,29,31,MESH:D015431,Disease,reduction efficiency,1720,20,32,MESH:D013431,Chemical,sulfate,2086,7,33,MESH:D013431,Chemical,sulfate,2147,7,34,MESH:D013440,Chemical,sulfide,2159,7,30147685,,1592598838791,chemical@MESH:D013440,disease@MESH:C566125,species@1651088,chemical@MESH:D003300,chemical@MESH:D006861,chemical@MESH:D008670,Front Microbiol. 2018 Aug 10,2018,Xia X,Wu S,Li L,Xu B,Wang G,,,,3,1651088,Species,Alishewanella Sp.

When essential sulfate reducing genes were respectively disrupted, Se(VI) was not reduced to red-colored SeNPs. Consequently, Se(VI) reduction was catalyzed by enzymes of the sulfate reducing pathway. For Se(IV) reduction, one of the potential periplasm molybdenum oxidoreductase named SerT was screened and further used to analyze Se(IV) reduction. Compared to the wild type and the complemented mutant strain, the ability of Se(IV) reduction was reduced 75% in the deletion mutant DeltaserT. Moreover, the Se(IV) reduction rate was significantly enhanced when the gene serT was overexpressed in Escherichia coli W3110.

However, many aspects of the mechanism and biological processes underlying Hg methylation, as well as any additional physiological functions of the hgcAB genes, remain unknown. Here, quantitative proteomics are used to identify changes in potential functional processes related to hgcAB gene deletion in the Hg-methylating bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ND132. Global proteomics analyses indicate that the wild type and DeltahgcAB strains are similar with respect to the whole proteome and the identified number of proteins, but differ significantly in the abundance of specific proteins. The authors observe changes in the abundance of proteins related to the glycolysis pathway and one-carbon metabolism, suggesting that the hgcAB gene pair is linked to carbon metabolism. Unexpectedly, the authors find that the deletion of hgcAB significantly impacts a range of metal transport proteins, specifically membrane efflux pumps such as those associated with heavy metal copper (Cu) export, leading to decreased Cu uptake in the DeltahgcAB mutant. This observation indicates possible linkages between this set of proteins and metal homeostasis in the cell. However, hgcAB gene expression is not induced by Hg, as evidenced by similarly low abundance of HgcA and HgcB proteins in the absence or presence of Hg (500 nm).

Yet the mechanism of biofilm formation by these bacteria has not been determined. Here we show that two supposedly identical wild-type cultures of the SRB Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough maintained in different laboratories have diverged in biofilm formation. From genome resequencing and subsequent mutant analyses, we discovered that a single nucleotide change within DVU1017, the ABC transporter of a type I secretion system (T1SS), was sufficient to eliminate biofilm formation in D. vulgaris Hildenborough. Two T1SS cargo proteins were identified as likely biofilm structural proteins, and the presence of at least one (with either being sufficient) was shown to be required for biofilm formation. Antibodies specific to these biofilm structural proteins confirmed that DVU1017, and thus the T1SS, is essential for localization of these adhesion proteins on the cell surface. We propose that DVU1017 is a member of the lapB category of microbial surface proteins because of its phenotypic similarity to the adhesin export system described for biofilm formation in the environmental pseudomonads. These findings have led to the identification of two functions required for biofilm formation in D. vulgaris Hildenborough and focus attention on the importance of monitoring laboratory-driven evolution, as phenotypes as fundamental as biofilm formation can be altered.IMPORTANCE The growth of bacteria attached to a surface (i.e., biofilm), specifically biofilms of sulfate-reducing bacteria, has a profound impact on the economy of developed nations due to steel and concrete corrosion in industrial pipelines and processing facilities. Furthermore, the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria in oil wells causes oil souring from sulfide production, resulting in product loss, a health hazard to workers, and ultimately abandonment of wells. Identification of the required genes is a critical step for determining the mechanism of biofilm formation by sulfate reducers. Here, the transporter by which putative biofilm structural proteins are exported from sulfate-reducing Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough cells was discovered, and a single nucleotide change within the gene coding for this transporter was found to be sufficient to completely stop formation of biofilm.",16,MESH:D013431,Chemical,sulfate,143,7,17,-,Chemical,SRB,170,3,18,MESH:D008670,Chemical,metal,267,5,19,-,Chemical,SRB,505,3,20,882,Species,Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough,509,36,21,882,Species,D. vulgaris Hildenborough,844,25,22,882,Species,D. vulgaris Hildenborough,1557,25,23,MESH:D013431,Chemical,sulfate,1827,7,24,MESH:D013431,Chemical,sulfate,2028,7,25,MESH:D009821,Chemical,oil,2074,3,26,MESH:D013440,Chemical,sulfide,2091,7,27,MESH:D013431,Chemical,sulfate,2313,7,28,MESH:D013431,Chemical,sulfate,2417,7,29,882,Species,Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough,2434,36,29042504,,1592598838791,chemical@MESH:D013440,chemical@-,species@882,chemical@MESH:D009821,chemical@MESH:D008670,chemical@MESH:D013431,MBio,2017,De León KB,Zane GM,Trotter VV,Krantz GP,Arkin AP,Butland GP,Walian PJ,Fields MW,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC5646257,,,,,,Wall JD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its removal by H2 -oxidizing microorganisms is essential to keep anaerobic degradation energetically favourable. Sulfate-reducing microorganisms (SRM) are known as the main H2 scavengers in anoxic marine sediments. Although the community of marine SRM has been extensively studied, those consuming H2 in situ are completely unknown. We combined metagenomics, PCR-based clone libraries, single-amplified genomes (SAGs) and metatranscriptomics to identify potentially H2 -consuming SRM in anoxic coastal sediments. The vast majority of SRM-related H2 ase sequences were assigned to group 1b and 1c [NiFe]-H2 ases of the deltaproteobacterial order Desulfobacterales. Surprisingly, the same sequence types were similarly highly expressed in spring and summer, suggesting that these are stable and integral members of the H2 -consuming community. Notably, one sequence cluster from the SRM group 1 consistently accounted for around half of all [NiFe]-H2 ase transcripts. Using SAGs, we could link this cluster with the 16S rRNA genes of the uncultured Sva0081-group of the family Desulfobacteraceae.

Counterintuitively, the collapse phenomenon was prevented by a single regulatory mutation. We have characterized the mechanism for collapse by conducting RNA-seq analysis, proteomics, microcalorimetry, and single-cell transcriptome analysis.

To investigate how these cells adapt to sulfur limitation, batch cultures were grown in defined medium containing either limiting or nonlimiting amounts of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) as the sole sulfur source. Protein and mRNA expression were measured before, during, and after the transition from exponential growth to stationary phase. Two distinct responses were observed, one as DMSP became exhausted and another as the cells acclimated to a sulfur-limited environment. The first response was characterized by increased transcription and translation of all ""Ca. Pelagibacter ubique"" genes downstream from the previously confirmed S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) riboswitches bhmT, mmuM, and metY. The proteins encoded by these genes were up to 33 times more abundant as DMSP became limiting. Their predicted function is to shunt all available sulfur to methionine. The secondary response, observed during sulfur-limited stationary phase, was a 6- to 10-fold increase in the transcription of the heme c shuttle-encoding gene ccmC and two small genes of unknown function (SAR11_1163 and SAR11_1164). This bacterium's strategy for coping with sulfur stress appears to be intracellular redistribution to support methionine biosynthesis rather than increasing organosulfur import. Many of the genes and SAM riboswitches involved in this response are located in a hypervariable genome region (HVR). One of these HVR genes, ordL, is located downstream from a conserved motif that evidence suggests is a novel riboswitch. IMPORTANCE ""Ca. Pelagibacter ubique"" is a key driver of marine biogeochemistry cycles and a model for understanding how minimal genomes evolved in free-living anucleate organisms. This study explores the unusual sulfur acquisition strategy that has evolved in these cells, which lack assimilatory sulfate reduction and instead rely on reduced sulfur compounds found in oxic marine environments to meet their cellular quotas. Our findings demonstrate that the sulfur acquisition systems are constitutively expressed but the enzymatic steps leading to the essential sulfur-containing amino acid methionine are regulated by a unique array of riboswitches and genes, many of which are encoded in a rapidly evolving genome region. These findings support mounting evidence that streamlined cells have evolved regulatory mechanisms that minimize transcriptional switching and, unexpectedly, localize essential sulfur acquisition genes in a genome region normally associated with adaption to environmental variation.",28,335992,Species,"Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique"" strain H",116,40,29,MESH:D013431,Chemical,sulfate,234,7,30,MESH:D013455,Chemical,sulfur,375,6,31,MESH:C068078,Chemical,dimethylsulfoniopropionate,491,26,32,MESH:C068078,Chemical,DMSP,519,4,33,MESH:D013455,Chemical,sulfur,537,6,34,MESH:C068078,Chemical,DMSP,725,4,35,MESH:D013455,Chemical,sulfur,788,6,36,198252,Species,Pelagibacter ubique,908,19,37,MESH:D012436,Chemical,S-adenosyl methionine,976,21,38,MESH:C068078,Chemical,DMSP,1112,4,39,MESH:D013455,Chemical,sulfur,1185,6,40,MESH:D008715,Chemical,methionine,1195,10,41,MESH:D013455,Chemical,sulfur,1247,6,27822545,,1592598838791,species@335992,chemical@-,chemical@MESH:D013455,chemical@MESH:D012436,chemical@MESH:C068078,chemical@MESH:D008715,mSystems,2016,Smith DP,Nicora CD,Carini P,Lipton MS,Norbeck AD,Smith RD,Giovannoni SJ,,3,198252,Species,Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique,57,30,42,MESH:D013455,Chemical,sulfur,1482,6,43,MESH:D008715,Chemical,methionine,1550,10,chemical@MESH:D013431,species@198252,,,,,,,,,44,198252,Species,,Pelagibacter ubique,1872,19,45,MESH:D013455,Chemical,sulfur,2068,6,46,MESH:D013431,Chemical,sulfate,2153,7,47,MESH:D013455,Chemical,sulfur,2199,6,48,MESH:D013455,Chemical,sulfur,2315,6,49,MESH:D013455,Chemical,sulfur,2420,6,50,-,Chemical,amino acid methionine,2438,21,51,MESH:D013455,Chemical,sulfur,2759,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC5069961,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A new family of NADH dehydrogenases, the flavin oxidoreductase (FlxABCD, previously called FloxABCD), was proposed to perform FBEB in sulphate-reducing organisms coupled with heterodisulfide reductase (HdrABC). We found that the hdrABC-flxABCD gene cluster is widespread among anaerobic bacteria, pointing to a general and important role in their bioenergetics. In this work, we studied FlxABCD of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough. The hdr-flx genes are part of the same transcriptional unit and are increased in transcription during growth in ethanol-sulfate, and to a less extent during pyruvate fermentation. Two mutant strains were generated: one where expression of the hdr-flx genes was interrupted and another lacking the flxA gene. Both strains were unable to grow with ethanol-sulfate, whereas growth was restored in a flxA-complemented strain. The mutant strains also produced very reduced amounts of ethanol compared with the wild type during pyruvate fermentation. Our results show that in D. vulgaris, the FlxABCD-HdrABC proteins are essential for NADH oxidation during growth on ethanol, probably involving a FBEB mechanism that leads to reduction of ferredoxin and the small protein DsrC, while in fermentation they operate in reverse, reducing NAD(+) for ethanol production.

Common use of dsrAB as a functional marker showed that dsrAB richness in many environments is dominated by novel sequence variants and collectively represents an extensive, largely uncharted sequence assemblage. Here, we established a comprehensive, manually curated dsrAB/DsrAB database and used it to categorize the known dsrAB diversity, reanalyze the evolutionary history of dsrAB and evaluate the coverage of published dsrAB-targeted primers. Based on a DsrAB consensus phylogeny, we introduce an operational classification system for environmental dsrAB sequences that integrates established taxonomic groups with operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at multiple phylogenetic levels, ranging from DsrAB enzyme families that reflect reductive or oxidative DsrAB types of bacterial or archaeal origin, superclusters, uncultured family-level lineages to species-level OTUs. Environmental dsrAB sequences constituted at least 13 stable family-level lineages without any cultivated representatives, suggesting that major taxa of sulfite/sulfate-reducing microorganisms have not yet been identified. Three of these uncultured lineages occur mainly in marine environments, while specific habitat preferences are not evident for members of the other 10 uncultured lineages. In summary, our publically available dsrAB/DsrAB database, the phylogenetic framework, the multilevel classification system and a set of recommended primers provide a necessary foundation for large-scale dsrAB ecology studies with next-generation sequencing methods.

Here, we present and analyse the first genome of sponge-associated SOB using a recently developed metagenomic binning strategy. The loss of transposase and virulence-associated genes and the maintenance of the ancient polyphosphate glucokinase gene suggested a stabilized SOB genome that might have coevolved with the ancient host during establishment of their association. Exclusive distribution in sponge, bacterial detoxification for the host (sulfide oxidation) and the enrichment for symbiotic characteristics (genes-encoding ankyrin) in the SOB genome supported the bacterial role as an intercellular symbiont. Despite possessing complete autotrophic sulfur oxidation pathways, the bacterium developed a much more versatile capacity for carbohydrate uptake and metabolism, in comparison with its closest relatives (Thioalkalivibrio) and to other representative autotrophs from the same order (Chromatiales). The ability to perform both autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolism likely results from the unstable supply of reduced sulfur in the sponge and is considered critical for the sponge-SOB consortium.

The importance of the abundant type I tetraheme cytochrome c3 (TpIc3) as an electron carrier during sulfate respiration was questioned by the previous isolation of a null mutation in the gene encoding TpIc3, cycA, in Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20. Whereas respiratory growth of the CycA mutant with lactate and sulfate was little affected, growth with pyruvate and sulfate was significantly impaired. We have explored the phenotype of the CycA mutant through physiological tests and transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. Data reported here show that electrons from pyruvate oxidation do not reach adenylyl sulfate reductase, the enzyme catalyzing the first redox reaction during sulfate reduction, in the absence of either CycA or the type I cytochrome c3:menaquinone oxidoreductase transmembrane complex, QrcABCD. In contrast to the wild type, the CycA and QrcA mutants did not grow with H2 or formate and sulfate as the electron acceptor. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of the CycA mutant showed that transcripts and enzymes for the pathway from pyruvate to succinate were strongly decreased in the CycA mutant regardless of the growth mode. Neither the CycA nor the QrcA mutant grew on fumarate alone, consistent with the omics results and a redox regulation of gene expression. We conclude that TpIc3 and the Qrc complex are D. alaskensis components essential for the transfer of electrons released in the periplasm to reach the cytoplasmic adenylyl sulfate reductase and present a model that may explain the CycA phenotype through confurcation of electrons.

Because of the presence of only two hydrogenases encoded in its genome, the periplasmic HynAB and cytoplasmic Ech hydrogenases, Desulfovibrio gigas is an excellent model organism for investigation of the specific function of each of these enzymes during growth. In this study, we analyzed the physiological response to the deletion of the genes that encode the two hydrogenases in D. gigas, through the generation of DeltaechBC and DeltahynAB single mutant strains. These strains were analyzed for the ability to grow on different substrates, such as lactate, pyruvate, and hydrogen, under respiratory and fermentative conditions. Furthermore, the expression of both hydrogenase genes in the three strains studied was assessed through quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. The results demonstrate that neither hydrogenase is essential for growth on lactate-sulfate, indicating that hydrogen cycling is not indispensable. In addition, the periplasmic HynAB enzyme has a bifunctional activity and is required for growth on H2 or by fermentation of pyruvate.

However, in sulfate-reducing bacteria, high concentrations of molybdate and tungstate oxyanions inhibit growth, thus requiring the tight regulation of their homeostasis. By a combination of bioinformatic and experimental techniques, we identified a novel regulator family, tungstate-responsive regulator (TunR), controlling the homeostasis of tungstate and molybdate in sulfate-reducing deltaproteobacteria. The effector-sensing domains of these regulators are similar to those of the known molybdate-responsive regulator ModE, while their DNA-binding domains are homologous to XerC/XerD site-specific recombinases. Using a comparative genomics approach, we identified DNA motifs and reconstructed regulons for 40 TunR family members. Positional analysis of TunR sites and putative promoters allowed us to classify most TunR proteins into two groups: (i) activators of modABC genes encoding a high-affinity molybdenum and tungsten transporting system and (ii) repressors of genes for toluene sulfonate uptake (TSUP) family transporters. The activation of modA and modBC genes by TunR in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough was confirmed in vivo, and we discovered that the activation was diminished in the presence of tungstate. A predicted 30-bp TunR-binding motif was confirmed by in vitro binding assays. A novel TunR family of bacterial transcriptional factors controls tungstate and molybdate homeostasis in sulfate-reducing deltaproteobacteria. We proposed that TunR proteins participate in protection of the cells from the inhibition by these oxyanions.

In this work we provide the first direct evidence that QmoABC and AprAB interact in Desulfovibrio spp., using co-immunoprecipitation, cross-linking Far-Western blot, tag-affinity purification, and surface plasmon resonance studies. This showed that the QmoABC-AprAB complex has a strong steady-state affinity (K(D) = 90 +- 3 nM), but has a transient character due to a fast dissociation rate. Far-Western blot identified QmoA as the Qmo subunit most involved in the interaction.

A better understanding of microbial community structures of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) and their in situ activities is essential for the efficient control of MICC. In this study, the microbial community structures and the in situ hydrogen sulfide production and consumption rates within biofilms and corroded materials developed on mortar specimens placed in a corroded manhole was investigated by culture-independent 16S rRNA gene-based molecular techniques and microsensors for hydrogen sulfide, oxygen, pH and the oxidation-reduction potential. The dark-gray gel-like biofilm was developed in the bottom (from the bottom to 4 cm) and the middle (4-20 cm from the bottom of the manhole) parts of the mortar specimens. White filamentous biofilms covered the gel-like biofilm in the middle part. The mortar specimens placed in the upper part (30 cm above the bottom of the manhole) were corroded. The 16S rRNA gene-cloning analysis revealed that one clone retrieved from the bottom biofilm sample was related to an SRB, 12 clones and 6 clones retrieved from the middle biofilm and the corroded material samples, respectively, were related to SOB. In situ hybridization results showed that the SRB were detected throughout the bottom biofilm and filamentous SOB cells were mainly detected in the upper oxic layer of the middle biofilm. Microsensor measurements demonstrated that hydrogen sulfide was produced in and diffused out of the bottom biofilms. In contrast, in the middle biofilm the hydrogen sulfide produced in the deeper parts of the biofilm was oxidized in the upper filamentous biofilm. pH was around 3 in the corroded materials developed in the upper part of the mortar specimens. Therefore, it can be concluded that hydrogen sulfide provided from the bottom biofilms and the sludge settling tank was emitted to the sewer atmosphere, then oxidized to corrosive compounds in the upper and middle parts of the manhole, and only the upper part of the mortar specimens were corroded, because in the middle part of the manhole the generated corrosive compounds (e.g., sulfuric acid) was reduced in the deeper parts of the biofilm.",15,MESH:C033158,Chemical,sulfuric acid,218,13,16,MESH:D013431,Chemical,sulfate,360,7,17,-,Chemical,SRB,387,3,18,MESH:D013455,Chemical,sulfur,396,6,19,MESH:D006862,Chemical,hydrogen sulfide,571,16,20,MESH:D006862,Chemical,hydrogen sulfide,821,16,21,MESH:D010100,Chemical,oxygen,839,6,22,-,Chemical,SRB,1356,3,23,-,Chemical,SRB,1534,3,24,MESH:D006862,Chemical,hydrogen sulfide,1719,16,25,MESH:D006862,Chemical,hydrogen sulfide,1832,16,26,MESH:D006862,Chemical,hydrogen sulfide,2071,16,27,MESH:C033158,Chemical,sulfuric acid,2417,13,,,,,,,19709714,,1592598838791,chemical@MESH:D006862,chemical@MESH:D013431,chemical@-,chemical@MESH:D013455,chemical@MESH:D010100,chemical@MESH:C033158,Water Res.,2009,Satoh H,Odagiri M,Ito T,Okabe S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Homologues have been found in photo- and chemotrophic sulfur-oxidizing prokaryotes (SOP), in which they are postulated to operate in the reverse direction, oxidizing sulfite to APS. Newly developed PCR assays allowed the amplification of 92-93 % (2.1-2.3 kb) of the APS reductase locus aprBA. PCR-based screening of 116 taxonomically divergent SOP reference strains revealed a distribution of aprBA restricted to photo- and chemotrophs with strict anaerobic or at least facultative anaerobic lifestyles, including Chlorobiaceae, Chromatiaceae, Thiobacillus, Thiothrix and invertebrate symbionts. In the AprBA-based tree, the SOP diverge into two distantly related phylogenetic lineages, Apr lineages I and II, with the proteins of lineage II (Chlorobiaceae and others) in closer affiliation to the enzymes of the sulfate-reducing prokaryotes (SRP). This clustering is discordant with the dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DsrAB) phylogeny and indicates putative lateral aprBA gene transfer from SRP to the respective SOB lineages. In support of lateral gene transfer (LGT), several beta- and gammaproteobacterial species harbour both aprBA homologues, the DsrAB-congruent 'authentic' and the SRP-related, LGT-derived gene loci, while some relatives possess exclusively the SRP-related apr genes as a possible result of resident gene displacement by the xenologue. The two-gene state might be an intermediate in the replacement of the resident essential gene. Collected genome data demonstrate the correlation between the AprBA tree topology and the composition/arrangement of the apr gene loci (occurrence of qmoABC or aprM genes) from SRP and SOP of lineages I and II.

Its ability to grow and its pathogenicity are linked to sulfur metabolism, which is considered a fertile area for the development of antibiotics, particularly because many of the sulfur acquisition steps in the bacterium are not found in the host. Sulfite reduction is one such mycobacterium-specific step and is the central focus of this paper. Sulfite reduction in Mycobacterium smegmatis was investigated using a combination of deletion mutagenesis, metabolite screening, complementation, and enzymology. The initial rate parameters for the purified sulfite reductase from M. tuberculosis were determined under strict anaerobic conditions [k(cat) = 1.0 (+/-0.1) electron consumed per second, and K(m(SO(3)(-2))) = 27 (+/-1) microM], and the enzyme exhibits no detectible turnover of nitrite, which need not be the case in the sulfite/nitrite reductase family. Deletion of sulfite reductase (sirA, originally misannotated nirA) reveals that it is essential for growth on sulfate or sulfite as the sole sulfur source and, further, that the nitrite-reducing activities of the cell are incapable of reducing sulfite at a rate sufficient to allow growth. Like their nitrite reductase counterparts, sulfite reductases require a siroheme cofactor for catalysis. Rv2393 (renamed che1) resides in the sulfur reduction operon and is shown for the first time to encode a ferrochelatase, a catalyst that inserts Fe(2+) into siroheme. Deletion of che1 causes cells to grow slowly on metabolites that require sulfite reductase activity. This slow-growth phenotype was ameliorated by optimizing growth conditions for nitrite assimilation, suggesting that nitrogen and sulfur assimilation overlap at the point of ferrochelatase synthesis and delivery.",19,1773,Species,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,35,26,20,MESH:D013455,Chemical,sulfur,172,6,21,MESH:D013455,Chemical,sulfur,295,6,22,MESH:D013447,Chemical,Sulfite,364,7,23,1772,Species,mycobacterium,394,13,24,1772,Species,Mycobacterium smegmatis,483,23,25,1773,Species,M. tuberculosis,692,15,26,MESH:D009573,Chemical,nitrite,902,7,27,MESH:D013431,Chemical,sulfate,1089,7,28,MESH:D013447,Chemical,sulfite,1100,7,29,MESH:D009573,Chemical,nitrite,1157,7,30,MESH:D013447,Chemical,sulfite,1223,7,31,26574,Gene,che1,1390,4,32,MESH:D013455,Chemical,sulfur,1411,6,17644602,,1592598838791,species@1772,chemical@MESH:D013455,species@1773,chemical@MESH:D009584,gene@26574,chemical@MESH:D013447,J.

Until now its polyphyletic distribution was most parsimoniously explained by multiple horizontal transfers of single genes rather than by a not-yet-identified ""metabolic island."" Here we provide evidence that the horizontal transfer of a gene cluster may indeed be responsible for the patchy distribution of sulfate-reducing prokaryotes (SRP) in the phylogenetic tree. We isolated three DNA fragments (32 to 41 kb) from uncultured, closely related SRP from DNA directly extracted from two distinct marine sediments. Fosmid ws39f7, and partially also fosmids ws7f8 and hr42c9, harbored a core set of essential genes for the dissimilatory reduction of sulfate, including enzymes for the reduction of sulfur intermediates and synthesis of the prosthetic group of the dissimilatory sulfite reductase. Genome comparisons suggest that encoded membrane proteins universally present among SRP are critical for electron transfer to cytoplasmic enzymes. In addition, novel, conserved hypothetical proteins that are likely involved in dissimilatory sulfate reduction were identified. Based on comparative genomics and previously published experimental evidence, a more comprehensive model of dissimilatory sulfate reduction is presented. The observed clustering of genes involved in dissimilatory sulfate reduction has not been previously found. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that genes responsible for dissimilatory sulfate reduction were concomitantly transferred in a single event among prokaryotes.

The remarkable conservation of gene arrangement and sequence across domain (bacterial versus archaeal) and physical (mesophilic versus thermophilic) boundaries indicates an essential role for DsvD in dissimilatory sulfite reduction and allowed the construction of conserved deoxyoligonucleotide primers for detection of the dissimilatory sulfite reductase genes in the environment.",7,881,Species,Desulfovibrio vulgaris,227,22,8,2234,Species,Archaeoglobus fulgidus,687,22,9,2234,Species,A. fulgidus,894,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7887608,,1592598838791,species@2234,species@881,,,,,Appl.

The genes encoding SRB proteins were isolated as suppressors of mutations in the RNA polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). The CTD and SRB proteins have been implicated in the response to transcriptional regulators. We report here the isolation of two new SRB genes, SRB10 and SRB11, which encode kinase- and cyclin-like proteins, respectively. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that the SRB10 and SRB11 proteins form a kinase-cyclin pair in the holoenzyme. The SRB10/11 kinase is essential for a normal transcriptional response to galactose induction in vivo. Holoenzymes lacking SRB10/11 kinase function are strikingly deficient in CTD phosphorylation. Although defects in the kinase substantially affect transcription in vivo, purified holoenzymes lacking SRB10/11 kinase function do not show defects in defined in vitro transcription systems, suggesting that the factors necessary to elicit the regulatory role of the SRB10/11 kinase are missing in these systems. These results indicate that the SRB10/11 kinase is involved in CTD phosphorylation and suggest that this modification has a role in the response to transcriptional regulators in vivo.",7,10575,Gene,SRB,198,3,8,10575,Gene,SRB,231,3,9,10575,Gene,SRB,354,3,10,10575,Gene,SRB,475,3,11,892,Gene,SRB11,496,5,12,892,Gene,SRB11,626,5,13,MESH:D005690,Chemical,galactose,760,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7877695,,1592598838791,gene@10575,gene@892,chemical@MESH:D005690,,,,Nature,1995,Liao SM,Zhang J,Jeffery DA,Koleske AJ,Thompson CM,Chao DM,Viljoen M,van Vuuren HJ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Young RA,,,,,,,,4695,3803,,,,4695,4695,4695,3803
